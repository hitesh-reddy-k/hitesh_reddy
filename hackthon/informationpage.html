        <p class="info-9">Started in 2002, Kalakriti Art Gallery has been one of the leading galleries in promoting contemporary South Asian art practices. Showcasing contemporary art from India and the sub-continent, ranging from historical figures like Raja Ravi Varma, and M.V. Dhurandhar, to iconic Modern Masters like Abanindranath and Gaganendranath Tagore; to post-independence luminaries Ram Kumar, K.G. Subramanyan, Ganesh Pyne; to contemporary trailblazers like Jogen Chowdhury, G.R. Iranna, Jitish Kallat, Reena Saini Kallat, Surya Prakash, Thota Vaikuntam,  K.S. Radhakrishna, Laxman Aelay, Seema Kohli, Bose Krishnamachari, Manish Pushkale; many emerging trailblazers like Om Soorya, Vinod Daroz, Vanita Gupta, Vinita Karim, Sujith S.N., Prabhakar Sahoo, Yassine Balbzioui, Yusuf, Wilson D’souza, Wonshondro Lyngdoh Buam, Emmanuelle Leblanc, Faiza Hassan, Hetal, Soghra Khurasani, Gouri Vermula, Anupama Alias, Ekta Singha, Bapi Das, to name few. Art critics like Alka Pande, Nancy Adajania, Ranjit Hoskote, and many more luminaries have held interactive sessions with the Hyderabad audience, which has helped the Hyderabad art scenario to mature over the past few years.

            Art has exceeded the boundaries imposed by the conventional medium of paint and canvas. Art forms like photography, installation art, video art, and performance art are considered mainstream fine art now and Kalakriti Art Gallery seeks out different forms of art to promote a different perspective to its audience.
            
            Kalakriti Art Gallery regularly organizes workshops, panel discussions, and film screenings that are centered around art. The gallery actively ventures into collaborative programs with Alliance Francaise, Goethe Zentrum, University of Hyderabad, etc., and has participated in a few national art fairs, namely Art Expo, Mumbai, India Art Fair, New Delhi, and The Luxury Expo, Hyderabad.
            
            Kalakriti has been part of National and International Art fairs and presented exhibitions at India Art Fair every year, Kochi Biennale and also presented an exhibition titled “Kal Aaj aur Kal” on the Evolution of Hyderabad landscape at “Agora 2017” at the city of Bordeaux, France.</p>
